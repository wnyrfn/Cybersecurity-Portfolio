Cybersecurity Documentation & TryHackMe Walkthroughs

Welcome to my security documentation repository. This project serves as a centralized location for my technical reports and step-by-step walkthroughs of various cybersecurity labs and machines.

🛡️ Statement of Purpose

The contents of this repository represent my hands-on experience in identifying vulnerabilities, performing reconnaissance, and executing exploitation techniques within controlled environments. Each report is a detailed walkthrough of a TryHackMe (THM) room, documenting my methodology and the remediation steps required to secure the systems.
